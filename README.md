# OcheCodes
I am a 3rd year student of Computer Science with fairly enough experience in several languages. i am project oriented and interested in learning new stuffs. i know C++, Java, VB, MIPS, Python. I recently stated taking course on Flutter with Dart, Data Science with Python and R. Hopefully by the time you are seeing this, i should have developed enough projects with this knowledge.
i just made a new change to my first repo on github
